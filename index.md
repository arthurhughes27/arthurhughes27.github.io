## Research

My PhD research concerns the development of statistical methods for gaining insight from high-dimensional molecular data in the context of vaccine development.

Broadly, my research interests include high-dimensionality, non-parametric statistics, causal inference, reproducibility, with applications in immunology and vaccinology.
